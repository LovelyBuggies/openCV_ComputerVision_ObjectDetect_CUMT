## openCV_ComputerVision_ObjectDetect_CUMT

> My internship project at CUMT from 2018.1 to 2018.2.

### Abstract

* This is an initialization of Kalman method applying to Object Detect.

* This is only a reference for primary computer vision learner and provide basic initialization to **Mixed Gaussian Method** & **Kalman Filtering**.

* If you find any bugs in this repository, you can open an [issue](https://github.com/LovelyBuggies/openCV_ComputerVision_ObjectDetect_CUMT/issues). Also, [pull request](https://github.com/LovelyBuggies/openCV_ComputerVision_ObjectDetect_CUMT/pulls) is welcomed.

### Structure

* **Computer Vision** : HINTS
* **MOG_BGS** : *MIXED GAUSSIAN METHOD - BACKGROUD SUBTRACTOR*
* **KF_ORP** : *KALMAN FILTERING - CORRECTION BETWEEN PREDICTION AND MEASUREMENT*
