## openCV_ComputerVision_ObjectDetect_CUMT

### Abstract

* This is an initialization of Kalman method applying to Object Detect.

* This is only a reference for primary computer vision learner and provide basic initialization to **Mixed Gaussian Method** & **Kalman Filtering**.

* If you find any bugs in this repository, welcome to send an e-mail to ninomyemail@163.com .

### Structure

* Computer Vision : HINTS
* MOG_BGS : MIXED GAUSSIAN METHOD - BACKGROUD SUBTRACTOR
* KF_ORP : KALMAN FILTERING - CORRECTION BETWEEN PREDICTION AND MEASUREMENT
